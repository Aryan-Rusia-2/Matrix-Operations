Debugging With the Test Center

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT DO MY RESULTS MEAN?

There are 5 possible results for a given test case:
1. Pass: Your output matched the expected result exactly. This is the best 
         outcome. If all of your test cases look like this, you are done!
2. Fail: Your output is wrong and did not match the expected result.
2. Presentation Error: Your output only matches the expected output 
         if all spaces are removed. You have a whitespace error (wrong 
         number of spaces, tabs, or newlines).
3. Timeout Error: Your program took too long to run and exceeded the 
         time limit per test case. 
         NOTE: You can find this timeout on the bottom row of the test 
         center application.
4. Runtime Error: Your code has a compilation error that prevents it from running.

HELP! I HAVE AN ERROR! WHAT DO I DO?

Use the debugging tools below to find the issue or see the "Debugging Tips" 
page for more advice.

HOW DO I SEE THE INPUT FILE?

1. Right click on the failed test case.
2. Click View Files -> Input.

                              DEBUGGING TOOLS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are several tools built into the test center which are designed to help
you compare your output to the expected output when you fail a test case. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

ERROR MESSAGE (for Runtime Error and Timeout Error):

1. Right-click on a test case that had a result of Runtime Error or Timeout Error.
2. Click "Error message".

You will see a popup window (designed to look somewhat like a terminal) that 
will display the error message. You can drag the box to resize it if desired.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

QUICK DIFFERENCE (for Fail and Presentation Error):

Used to compare the differences between your output and the expected output.

1. Right-click on a test case that has a result of Fail or Presentation Error.
2. Click "Quick difference".
3. A popup window will open. Read the instructions and symbol legend to 
   interpret the output.

Note that Quick Difference can be somewhat difficult to interpret, but it is 
the most reliable of all the comparison tools because it is built-in to the
Test Center application.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

VIEW FILES (for Fail and Presentation Error):

Allows you to view the raw input, output, and expected files directly by 
opening them in your default text editor.

1. Right-click on a test case that has a result of Fail or Presentation Error.
2. Click View Files -> Input to view the Input file.
3. Click View Files -> Your Output to view the file that your code generated.
4. Click View Files -> Expected to view the Expected output for that test.
5. Click View Files -> Open All to open all three files at once.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

DIFFMERGE (for Fail and Presentation Error):

Diffmerge is an external tool allowing you to easily visualize the differences 
between two files.

1. Right-click on a test case that has a result of Fail or Presentation Error.
2. Click "Diffmerge" -> XXX-stdout.txt (where XXX is the test case number).
3. The Diffmerge tool should open successfully. On the top you will see the 
   Expected output, while on the bottom is your output (your output file is 
   copied into the Outputs subdirectory when a test is run). Any differences 
   are shown in red.
4. You can view the files side-by-side by clicking the "Split Window Vertically"
   button (the symbol with two vertical bars).

Diffmerge is not part of TCA but is a separate program that you can download 
for free. It is available on all the major platforms. You can install it from 
here (links last updated May 22, 2018):
